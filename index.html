      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Fibonacci numbers are a simple mathematical sequence of integers,
        defined by the following pattern.
      </p>

      <code>
          Fn=Fn-1+Fn-2
        </code>

      <p>
        where F0=0 and F1=1. The sequence then becomes 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 and
        so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has a lot of interesting mathematical properties, even its
        applications in nature, but in this article we will talk about
        implmenting a Fibonacci function in Javascript.

      <h2>Recursion</h2>
      <p>
        in Javascript, we can easly construct any Fibonacci number using
        recursion, like so...
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
            const fib = n => {
              if(n < 2) return n;
              return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
            };
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        we can even shorten this to <code>const fib = n = => n < 2 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);</code> if we
        want to do it in one line. This however is a inefficent implementation. Let's see why
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's see what it calculates when we want to know the 4th Fibonacci number. The initial function
        will return <code>fib(3) + fib(4)</code>, which in turn will return
        <code>(fib(2) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))</code>.
        We already see, <code>fib(2)</code> will run twice. For calculating <code>fib(4)</code>, this may not be an
        issue, but
        when running <code>fib(23)</code>, we can already see that <code>fib(4)</code> runs 6765 times - not the most
        efficient
        code, since we only have to run that once to know what it will be.
