      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Fibonacci numbers are a simple mathematical sequence of integers,
        defined by the following pattern.
      </p>

      <code>
          Fn=Fn-1+Fn-2
        </code>

      <p>
        where F0=0 and F1=1. The sequence then becomes 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 and
        so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has a lot of interesting mathematical properties, even its
        applications in nature, but in this article we will talk about
        implmenting a Fibonacci function in Javascript.

      <h2>Recursion</h2>
      <p>
        in Javascript, we can easly construct any Fibonacci number using
        recursion, like so...
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
            const fib = n => {
              if(n < 2) return n;
              return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
            };
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        we can even shorten this to <code>const fib = n = => n < 2 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);</code> if we
        want to do it in one line. This however is a inefficent implementation. Let's see why
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's see what it calculates when we want to know the 4th Fibonacci number. The initial function
        will return <code>fib(3) + fib(4)</code>, which in turn will return
        <code>(fib(2) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))</code>.
        We already see, <code>fib(2)</code> will run twice. For calculating <code>fib(4)</code>, this may not be an
        issue, but
        when running <code>fib(23)</code>, we can already see that <code>fib(4)</code> runs 6765 times - not the most
        efficient
        code, since we only have to run that once to know what it will be.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>A way around the inefficiency</h2>
      <p>
        A way around this is to save each result in an array. We can simply construct an array with the Fibonacci
        numbers, and check if the number we want to compute is in the array, and if not, extend the array to be
        long enough. For example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          const fib = n => {
            const arr = [0, 1];
            const get = m => {
              if(arr.length == m) arr.push(arr[m - 1] + arr[m - 2]);
              if(arr.length > m) return arr[m];
              else return get(m - 1) + get(m - 2);
            };
            return get(n);
          };
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        this is a lot more effcient, because it remembers the numbers and doesn't run more calculations
        than it needs to. If we were going to use this function a lot, we can even do something like this:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          const fib = n => {
            const get = m => {
              if(fib._all.length == m) fib._all.push(fib._all[m - 1] + fib._all[m - 2]);
              if(fib._all.length > m) return fib._all[m];
              else return get(m - 1) + get(m - 2);
            };
            return get(n);
          };
          fib._arr = [0, 1];
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        which saves the array for future calls to the <code>fib</code> function;
      </p>
