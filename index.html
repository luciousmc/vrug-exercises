      <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number" target="_blank">
          Fibonacci numbers</a> are a simple mathematical sequence of integers,
        defined by the following pattern.
      </p>

      <code>
          Fn=Fn-1+Fn-2
        </code>

      <p>
        where F0=0 and F1=1. The sequence then becomes 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 and
        so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has a lot of interesting mathematical properties, even its
        applications in nature, but in this article we will talk about
        implmenting a Fibonacci function in Javascript.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">Recursion</h2>
      <p>
        in Javascript, we can easly construct any Fibonacci number using
        recursion, like so...
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
        const fib = n => {
          if(n < 2) return n;
          return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
        };
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        we can even shorten this to <code>const fib = n = => n < 2 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);</code> if we
        want to do it in one line. This however is a inefficent implementation. Let's see why
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's see what it calculates when we want to know the 4th Fibonacci number. The initial function
        will return <code>fib(3) + fib(4)</code>, which in turn will return
        <code>(fib(2) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))</code>.
        We already see, <code>fib(2)</code> will run twice. For calculating <code>fib(4)</code>, this may not be an
        issue, but
        when running <code>fib(23)</code>, we can already see that <code>fib(4)</code> runs 6765 times - not the most
        efficient
        code, since we only have to run that once to know what it will be.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">A way around the inefficiency</h2>
      <p>
        A way around this is to save each result in an array. We can simply construct an array with the Fibonacci
        numbers, and check if the number we want to compute is in the array, and if not, extend the array to be
        long enough. For example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          const fib = n => {
            const arr = [0, 1];
            const get = m => {
              if(arr.length == m) arr.push(arr[m - 1] + arr[m - 2]);
              if(arr.length > m) return arr[m];
              else return get(m - 1) + get(m - 2);
            };
            return get(n);
          };
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        this is a lot more effcient, because it remembers the numbers and doesn't run more calculations
        than it needs to. If we were going to use this function a lot, we can even do something like this:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          const fib = n => {
            const get = m => {
              if(fib._all.length == m) fib._all.push(fib._all[m - 1] + fib._all[m - 2]);
              if(fib._all.length > m) return fib._all[m];
              else return get(m - 1) + get(m - 2);
            };
            return get(n);
          };
          fib._arr = [0, 1];
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        which saves the array for future calls to the <code>fib</code> function;
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Math, though.</h2>
      <p>
        However, mathematicians might say - why would you do recursion? You don't need that!
        And yeah, we don't. With a little bit of trickery, we can find a function that outputs
        the correct Fibonacci number without ever needing to compute the previous one.
        How about this:
      </p>

      <code>
        const fib = n => Math.round((.5 + 1.25 ** .5)) ** n * .2 ** .5);
      </code>

      <p>
        Wait, what?? that actually works? Wellm, yeah, until the 71st Fibonacci number, when
        the inaccuracy of the floats in the math expressions start acting up and the
        mathematical function actually gives a value that is off by 1. Bummer, but 70 correct
        ones with barely any memory usage is pretty good!
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        What's the conclusion here? Not sure. I think it's good to think about what you want
        from your programs. Do you want efficiency? Do you want accuracy? Do you want readability?
        Do you want a little memory usage as possible?
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, one other thing to note - math can be pretty cool. Just making sure I got that across.
